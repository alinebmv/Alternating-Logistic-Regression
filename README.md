# Alternating Logistic Regression

## Objectives
In this paper, we studied the fungal endophytes at multiple hierarchical nesting levels using the ALR analysis. The study objectives included the following: 
* to assess, using the mean structure, whether the occurrence of fungal endophytes at many distinct taxonomic levels is influenced by environmental variables; 
* to determine whether there is some leaf part preference in the fungal endophyte colonization;
* to evaluate, using the dependence structure, whether fungal endophytes at many distinct taxonomic levels exhibit as-
sociations within a leaf, individual host tree, and collection site; and 
* to appraise whether increasing the distance among different individual host trees in the same collection site will decrease the association of distinct taxonomic fungal groups.
